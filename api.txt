Gazette - Main container module

Gazette::Client - API client for making requests.  Requests look like the following:

@client = Gazette::Client.new("username", :set => "of", :client => "options")

Once a client has been established, you can make the following calls:

@client.authenticate - authenticate the user
@client.add(:url => "http://...", :title => "my title") - Adds a URL to the users instapaper account.

The response from API calls return Gazette::Response object, which holds the actual status code and success/failure of the request.  Methods like #succeeded? can be used to check
on the status of the API call.

Gazette::Request - Class for making the request.  Holds on to instances of the Configuration and Credentials classes for use.
