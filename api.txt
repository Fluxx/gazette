Gazette - Main container module

Gazette::Client - API client for making requests.  Requests look like the following:

@client = Gazette::Client.new("username", :set => "of", :client => "options")

Once a client has been established, you can make the following calls:

@client.authenticate - authenticate the user
@client.add(:url => "http://...", :title => "my title") - Adds a URL to the users instapaper account.

The response from API calls return Gazette::Response object, which holds the actual status code and success/failure of the request.  Methods like #succeeded? can be used to check
on the status of the API call.

TODO
--------------------------------------
- Add FakeWeb and build stub API.
- Create Response class
  - Response values (200, 403, 500, etc) or throw exception, i.e. Gazette::Response::InvalidCredentials.
  - #succeeded?
  - #headers (Content-Location, X-Instapaper-Title)
- Audit app for correct usage given the "preferred language" section of the API docs.
- JSONP (v2)
