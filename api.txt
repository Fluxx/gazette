Gazette::Configuration::Api - Container class for holding API endpoint definition, if the
request is secure or not, etc.

Gazette::Client - API client for making requests.  Requests look like the following:

But cal also take the following forms

Gazette::Client.new(:username => "username", :password => "password")
Gazette::Client.new("username", "password")
Gazette::Client.new(:username => "username", :set => "of", :client => "options")

Once a client has been established, you can make the following calls:

@client.add(:url => "http://...", :title => "my title") - Adds a URL to the users instapaper account.

on the status of the API call.
